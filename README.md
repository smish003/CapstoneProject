# <ins>Insights in Cancer Data: The Power of Analysis </ins>

# Summary

Cancer is a broad category of diseases that can begin in practically any organ or tissue of the body when aberrant cells develop uncontrollably, cross their normal boundaries to infect other body parts, and/or spread to other organs. It was reported by [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cancer) in February 2022 that One in six deaths, or around 10 million deaths in 2020 is due to cancer, making it the top cause of death globally. The most widespread cancers include breast, prostate, lung, colon, and rectum cancers. Lots of research are going around cancer treatments and drug effectiveness.

In order to acquire some insights from the data, I will be working on some of the cancer datasets in general which are made public by the National Cancer Institute and other platforms in my research study. 	In addition, I'll conduct some research on breast cancer, a subject that's highly popular among women these days. 

The American Cancer Society estimates that in the United States in 2022 ***“About 287,850 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in women. About 51,400 new cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) will be diagnosed. About 43,250 women will die from breast cancer”***

This project will be divided into several phases, and the specified analysis such as Descriptive, Predictive, Statistical, and Data Analysis on certain parameters, will be performed. Each of the phases will be discussed in detail in the Project Overview.

# Motivation

One of the rapidly spreading diseases that affects many individuals worldwide is cancer. The main reason I'm interested in working on this project is because of a real-life occurrence in my family when my grandmother was diagnosed with cancer that had advanced and was no longer treatable. However, I discovered several further incidents close to my community since then. Today, several organizations are diagnosing various treatments and determining the best course of action.

A huge amount people come to treat their cancer in United States. Millions of people seeking medical care in the United States have selected from among a vast number of hospitals. Each hospital has a particular reputation that influences patients to pick it over another.

In my research study I would be analyzing some of the hospitals present in California which treats cancer patients and will try to identify possible lacking the resources and their issues being observed within their system and then they can use the report results to construct ways to address any potential problems in their system.

# System Architecture
The system architecture that needs to be followed to is listed below:


# Overview of the Project Phases and Dataset

* **Phase-1(Number of Cancer Surgeries (Volume) Performed in California Hospitals):**

     *This dataset includes the information about the volume of annual cancer surgeries conducted in California hospitals for 11 different cancer kinds, including bladder, breast, brain, colon, esophagus, liver, lung, pancreatic, prostate, rectum, and stomach.*
 
 * **Phase-2(Hospital Characteristics List for California Providers in State Fiscal Year 2019-20):**
 
     *The dataset includes a list of 15 characteristics for hospitals serving the State of California in Fiscal Year 2019–20, such as OSHPD ID, HCAI Provider Name, Designated Neonatal Intensive Care Unit status as defined by DHCS, Designated Public Hospital status, Non-designated Public Hospital, HCAI Rural Hospital status, DHCS Designated Remote Rural status, Cost-to-Charge Ratio, Wage Index Value, Wage Index Value-Adjusted for California Neutrality, Unadjusted Statewide Base Rate, Wage-Adjusted Statewide Base Rate, Rehab Rate*
     
 * **Phase-3(Patients Leaving California Hospitals Against Medical Advice (AMA)):**
 
     *This dataset includes discharge numbers, and a breakdown of discharge counts by patients who left against medical recommendation. The information is separated into groups according to the year of discharge, admission type, patient age, anticipated payer, primary diagnosis, race/ethnicity group, and sex.*
 
  * **Phase-4(Comprehensive list of approved cancer medications created by the Anticancer Fund):**
 
     *The Anticancer Fund's CancerDrugs DB is a carefully managed database of approved cancer medications. The NCI, FDA, EMA, and other data sources provide the source data. The goal is to offer a database of approved medications used to treat cancer that can be easily filtered for researchers, doctors, and regulators. Drugs used for diagnostic purposes are not included, nor are those used to treat cancer symptoms or for other forms of supportive care. Additionally excluded are investigational medicines and substances utilized in clinical trials.*
     
 * **Phase-5(Financial Burden of Cancer Care):**
 
     *The national cancer-attributed medical care costs in the United States.*
     
 * **Phase-6(Effects of COVID-19 on Hospital Utilization Trends):**
 
     *In-hospital deaths in three hospital settings are counted in this dataset (inpatient discharges, emergency department, and ambulatory surgery). Asthma, cancer, cardiac arrest, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), COVID-19, diabetes, homelessness, hypertension, obesity, pneumonia, respiratory arrest/failure, sepsis, and stroke are among the common medical conditions/categories for which monthly totals are provided for the entire state and are also included in the monthly totals for each of these conditions/categories.*
   
 * **Phase-7(Advanced Stage Breast Cancer Among Women 40 Years and Older, by Medical Service Study Area (MSSA), California Counties, 2010-2014):**
 
     *Geographical locations with a disproportionately high number of breast tumors detected at a late or otherwise advanced stage were identified by analysis of data from the population-based, statewide California Cancer Registry (CCR). The CCR provided information on women with a breast cancer diagnosis between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2014, aged 40 and older. By comparing the percentage of upper-socioeconomic, non-Hispanic white women in counties and Medical Service Study Areas (MSSAs) with the percentage of late-stage breast cancer cases nationwide, proportional incidence ratios (PIRs) were computed.*
     
 * **Phase-8(Premise General Population COVID-19 Health Services Disruption Survey 2020):**
 
     *The COVID-19 Health Services Disruption Survey 2020 is a collection of surveys designed to measure the degree of disruption to various health services brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent governmental directives and behavioral modifications to slow the disease's spread.76 nations participated in this survey, which was carried out utilizing the smartphone-based Premise data gathering technology. Individual people from the general population served as respondents. 52,492 respondents provided information that was gathered. The poll concentrated on the degree of interference with the delivery of general healthcare services, including access to healthcare professionals and prescription drugs. The survey was created primarily to evaluate the shift in service delivery levels before and right away after the start of the COVID-19 worldwide pandemic. It is not intended to use the survey's data to determine the overall quality of health service delivery.*
     
 * **Phase-9(Global Burden of Disease):**
 
     *This dataset consists of information about 30 years of data with the goal of providing timely, valid, and relevant assessments of critical health outcomes. It will be interesting to analyze the data with respect to 5 -10 years for all the health outcomes versus cancer disease. The dataset is obtained from Global Health Data Exchange (commonly known as GHDx). The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's GHDx database compiles statistics on population health around the world (IHME). IHME is a non-profit research organization dedicated to finding the most effective ways to create a healthy society.*
