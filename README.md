# Summary

Cancer is a broad category of diseases that can begin in practically any organ or tissue of the body when aberrant cells develop uncontrollably, cross their normal boundaries to infect other body parts, and/or spread to other organs. It was reported by [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cancer) in February 2022 that One in six deaths, or around 10 million deaths in 2020 is due to cancer, making it the top cause of death globally. The most widespread cancers include breast, prostate, lung, colon, and rectum cancers. Lots of research are going around cancer treatments and drug effectiveness.

In order to acquire some insights from the data, I will be working on some of the cancer datasets in general which are made public by the National Cancer Institute and other platforms in my research study. 	In addition, I'll conduct some research on breast cancer, a subject that's highly popular among women these days. 

The American Cancer Society estimates that in the United States in 2022 ***“About 287,850 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in women. About 51,400 new cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) will be diagnosed. About 43,250 women will die from breast cancer”***

This project will be divided into several phases, and the specified analysis such as Descriptive, Predictive, Statistical, and Data Analysis on certain parameters, will be performed. Each of the phases will be discussed in detail in the Project Overview.
